            <h2>The Creation of Lua</h2>
            <p> In 1993, three members of a computer graphics group (Tecgraf) at the Pontifical Catholic University in Brazil 
                created the Lua scripting language. These members were Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique 
                de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes. Learn more about Lua's history <a href="https://www.lua.org/history.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p> 
                
            <p> At this time, Brazil placed heavy restrictions on software imports to bolster its computer science industry.
                This significantly impacted the workflow of Tecgraf, which required a scripting language that was practical 
                given these restrictions. Additionally, the nature of these trade laws made the long-term accessibility of 
                certain tools uncertain. Therefore, Lua was implemented as a highly adaptable and lightweight language.

            <h2>Core Issues Lua Solves</h2>
            <p>
                Lua is a scripting language. By definition, it integrates into another already-existent project to add
                automation, control behavior, and extend functionality. The specialty Lua has against other scripting languages
                is its lightweight framework and accessibility. Learn more about Lua's features <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/lua-programming" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>Lightweight Framework:</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Simple language (21 keywords)</li>
                <li>Faster interpreter</li>
                <li>Compact size (fits small systems)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accessibility:</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Flexible (custom metatables)</li>
                <li>Easy-to-link (function calls between C/C++)</li>
                <li>Adapts to team styles (multi-paradigm)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lua In Today's Workspace</h2>
            <p> 
                Lua is a very simple language to understand. It is frequently used by people who have no formal 
                computer science education. This is evident in the mods and add-ons made by certain gaming communities (Roblox, 
                Garry's Mod, World of Warcraft). Additionally, it's frequently used in smart devices (Internet-of-Things) 
                such as Raspberry Pi, fitness trackers, or smartwatches due to its small size and fast runtime. Although 
                not the main language in any project, Lua remains a very powerful scripting tool that is desired for its 
                ergonomics and accessibility to a broad audience. Learn more about Lua's applications <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_applications_using_Lua" target="_blank">here</a>.
