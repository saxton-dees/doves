            <h2>The Creation of Lua</h2>
            <p> In 1993, three members of a computer graphics group (Tecgraph) at the Pontifical Catholic University in Brazil 
                created the Lua scripting language. These members were Roberto Ierusalimschy, Luiz Henrique 
                de Figueiredo, and Waldemar Celes.
            </p> 
                
            <p> At this time, Brazil placed heavy restrictions on software imports to bolster it's computer science industry.
                This significantly impacted the workflow of Tecgraf, who required a scripting language that was practical 
                given these restrictions. Additionally, the nature of these trade laws made the long-term accessibility of 
                certain tools uncertain. Therefore, Lua was implemented as a highly-adaptable and light-weight language.

            <h2>Core Issues Lua Solves</h2>
            <p>
                Lua is a scripting language. By definition, it integrates into another already-existent project to add
                automation, control behavior, and extend functionality. The specialty Lua has against other scripting langauges
                is its light-framework and accessibility.
            </p>

            <h3>Light-Framework:</h3> <ul>
                <li>simple language (21 keywords)</li>
                <li>faster interpreter</li>
                <li>compact size (fits small systems)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Accessibility:</h3> <ul>
                <li>flexible (custom metatables)</li>
                <li>easy-to-link (function calls between C/C++)</li>
                <li>adapts to team styles (multi-paradigm)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lua In Today's Workspace</h2>
            <p> 
                Lua is a very simple language to understand. It is frequently used by people that have no formal 
                computer-science education. This is evident in the mods and add-ons made by certain gaming communities (Roblox, 
                Garry's Mod, World of Warcraft). Additionally, it's frequently used in smart devices (Internet-of-Things) 
                such as Raspberry Pi, fitness trackers, or smartwatches due to it's small size and fast runtime. Although 
                not the main langauge in any project, Lua remains a very poewrful scripting tool that is desired for its 
                ergonomics and accessibility to a broad audience.
